# Advent Of Craft

Christmas is here!

Your journey as a developer has probably taken many turns.

You probably had to troubleshoot and refactor a piece of code that you still have nightmares about.

You might have been stuck in a team when you never have time to improve your code base because `"We have to deliver more features"`.

Heck, you probably still are.

We feel you, and in the spirit of Christmas, you deserve a gift.

We have the privilege this year, in collaboration with Yoan, to bring to you the Advent of Craft. 
This is a journey into software craftsmanship.

Each day, you will be taken in a small aspect of software craftsmanship. Each day, you will have an exercise with a topic to look at in a small bite approach and hopefully you will learn something.

From refactoring to testing to reviewing, all aspects are going to be explored.

A repository is available and each day a topic will appear with a proposed solution for the day before.

We hope you enjoy the ride. 
Happy Crafting!
